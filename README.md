# aes-mysql-java

MySQL offers robust encryption capabilities through its AES_ENCRYPT() function, which allows sensitive data to be securely stored. This project demonstrates how to integrate and decrypt such data using Java, enhancing data security in applications. 

The application retrieves encrypted data from the MySQL database and decrypts it using Java. Decrypted data is printed to the console or can be integrated into your application logic.

Features:

- Decrypt MySQL AES encrypted data using Java.  
- Utilize Spring Boot for application setup and MySQL connectivity.

Prerequisites:

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your development environment:

- Java Development Kit (JDK)  
- Maven or Gradle build tool  
- MySQL Server  
- MySQL Workbench (optional, for database management)  

The application retrieves encrypted data from the MySQL database and decrypts it using Java. Decrypted data is printed to the console or can be integrated into your application logic.
